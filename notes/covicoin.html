                <p>This project won the 2nd prize at <a href="https://frosthack.com" target="_blank">FrostHack 2021</a> organized by Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi. I built this with my team members <a href="https://laxya.co" target="_blank">Laxya</a> (backend) and <a href="https://www.behance.net/samvrantsamataray" target="_blank">Samvrant</a> (designer).</p>
                <h1>Problem</h1>
                <p>"With Indiaâ€™s coronavirus crisis becoming increasingly more desperate and beds, medicine, and oxygen supplies scarce, people in cities across the country are relying on Twitter and the kindness of strangers for help during a time of national upheaval."</p>
                <p>The above extract is from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/04/28/india-coronavirus-social-media-help/" target="_blank">this</a> article by the Washington Post about how the COVID crisis in India is growing out of proportion resulting in a shortage of resources and communication gaps between the suppliers and the people in need. All of this is resulting in people tweeting asking about the availability of oxygen cylinders and other medical care resources in their area. </p>
                <p>The problem is that many of these tweets don't get 100+ retweets or likes and are hence not being noticed by people who have resources or leads. Many of these tweets are being ignored for hours and hours without getting even a single reply. </p>
                <p>This is demoralizing for the person who posted the tweet and is directly or indirectly hurting the person who the resources are being asked for. </p>
                <h1>Solution</h1>
                <p>Seeing how in this lockdown, everyone is working/studying from home and are able to spare a minimum of 1-2 hours per day for leisure activities, we decided to put their idle time to use to solve the above-mentioned problem.</p>
                <p>The solution is a gamified experience that gives the user redeemable credits based on how many people they help. The system shows the users specific tweets which are asking for leads about COVID resources and the users get redeemable credits according to how much they can help the person by verifying leads and replying to that tweet.</p>
